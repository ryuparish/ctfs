LLMNR - Link Local Multicast Name Resolution

When a DNS on a server fails on a domain controller/server, the server may let out a broadcast to try and resolve the DNS that is requested. While the broadcast
happens, we can listen using something like Responder and catch the request and instead obtain the hashes of the username and password, which is always
sent in an LLMNR broadcast.
