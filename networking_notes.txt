Open Systems Interconnection Model (The Networking Model)
Layer 1:
    The User Layer (Application)
Layer 2:
    The Program Layer (Presentation)
    - The translator between the innerworkings and the GUI, and also vice versa.
Layer 3:
    Session Layer (Session)
    - Establishes some sort of same-time connection between two devices to try and
    sync their data.
    - Creation of packets.
Layer 4:
    Transport Layer (Transport [kind of the same as layer3])
    - Either TCP or UDP connections.
Layer 5:
    Network Layer (Network) / Routers
    - Communication of the recieved data through IP addresses.
Layer 6:
    Data Link Layer (Data Link) / Switches
    - Data is linked from software packets and IP addresses to MAC addresses located in NIC(Network Interface Card).
    - Switches can split up packets to go to the network or use IP/TCP protocol to send them out, and from device to device on the same network.
Layer 7:
    Physical Layer (Physical)
    - Physical CPU, hardware, cables, and bits/bytes.


Type of Protocols:
    
    Device Communication
        TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - Standard device to device protocol that is secure with the Three-way Handshake.
        UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - Stream of data that can be incomplete, low latency and reliability.
        ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) - MAC addresses can be connected to IP Address by a device broadcasting the question of who has a certain IP Address in which the corresponding MAC
            address will respond.
        DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - MAC addresses without an IP Address will be assigned an IP address on a network through this protocol.

    Internet Communication
        HTTP Headers (additional optional information send with HTTP requests):
            Browser to Server
                Host - Which website (especially if a single domain has many websites)
                User-Agent - Version of browser and browser software.
                Content Length - The size of the data sent in the request.
                Accept Encoding - Tells the web server what type of encoding the browser may support.
                Cookie - Typically data sent to the server, especially if the web server has requested the browser to use one.

            Server to Browser
                Set-Cookie - Tells the browser to set a certain cookie (info to store) in it.
                Cache-Control - How long to store the data until it should request a fresh data batch.
                Content-Type - The type of content (Video, image, audio, txt, html)
                Content-Encoding - The compression used on a file being sent.
        HTTP 
        HTTPS
        URL (Uniform Resource Locator) - Specifically to tell your browser what to do.
